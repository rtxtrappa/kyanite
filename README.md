# Kyanite V1
> Kyanite is an open source AI aimbot based off of [Lunar Lite](https://github.com/xxreflextheone/lunar-lite)
Kyanite is an very slightly edited version of [Lunar Lite](https://github.com/xxreflextheone/lunar-lite).

Kyanite offers a triggerbot and updated packages for the orignal [Lunar](https://github.com/zeyad-mansour/lunar).

## About

Kyanite can be modified to work with a variety of FPS games; however, it is currently configured for Fortnite. Besides being general purpose, the main advantage of using Kyanite is that it does not meddle with the memory of other processes.

Kyanite uses [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
